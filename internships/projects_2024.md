## Summer project ideas 2024

NOTE: this is the project ideas list for 2024. See [here for the 2025 list](https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/edit/main/internships/projects_2025.md).

Below is a list of ideas for longer summer projects 2024 with `sktime`.
For getting started or smaller projects, see our curated list of [good first issues and advice on getting started as an sktime developer](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1147).

The below list is only an ideas starter - we welcome and actively encourage bringing your own ideas to the table!
