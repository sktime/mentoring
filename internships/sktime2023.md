## Why sktime?
Time series data is ubiquitous in many applications. Examples include sensor readings from industrial processes, spectroscopy wave length data from chemical samples, or bed-side monitor medical data from patients. Developing advanced time series analysis capabilities for researchers and practitioners is one of the major challenges of contemporary machine learning.

sktime is a new Python toolbox for machine learning with time series and, to the best of our knowledge, the first unified toolbox for time series. Our ambition is to provide for time series what scikit-learn provides for tabular data. This involves extending scikit-learn to the different time series learning tasks, such as time series classification, clustering, forecasting and anomaly detection. To find out more, check out our [paper](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/assets/papers/sktime_ml_systems_neurips2019.pdf) published at the [Workshop on Systems for ML at NeurIPS 2019](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/).

## Internship set-up

The `sktime` internship is a paid internship programme, through June-August 2023.

* `sktime` interns participate in onboarding events, regular stand-ups and mentoring throughout the period
* the internship is virtual, via GitHub and Discord
* full time dedication to the internship project is expected throughout the internship period (June 5 - Sep 1), excluding 5 working days of pause
* upon request, we can accommodate for flexible time arrangements, moving start and end within reason, or a shorter internship period.
* the internship consists of collaborating with `sktime` developers, as well as other interns and mentees, on `sktime` and an approved project (applicants can propose projects)
* the internship is accompanied by a flat weekly pro-rata of 420 EUR, to be disbursed monthly. Disbursement is via invoicing every 4 weeks via our fiscal host, the non-profit Open Collective Europe (OCE). Also see OCE's [guidelines on invoicing](https://docs.opencollective.com/oceurope/how-it-works/expenses).
* the internship does not constitute formal employment, terms and conditions of OCE apply. Reimbursement at the discretion of the sktime project as hosted by OCE.

## The application process

Here is the timeline for the application process. Each of the steps is explained in detail below.

- May 19, 18:00 (UTC). You must complete an entrance task and the sktime application form by this deadline.
  - If you want feedback on a proposal, then you must complete these three steps one week earlier. See details below.
- May 26. We will inform you of the outcome of your application *latest* by May 26, but hopefully sooner.
- May 29 and May 30. Interviews will happen during this time. Please keep these dates free if possible.
- June 2. We will take at most until June 2 inform you of the outcome of the interview.
- June 5 - June 9. Internship starts, onboarding week with onboarding events.
  Please ensure you keep your time during the internship period free, and especially the first week.

If you get stuck or have questions, please feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/54ACzaFsn7) or [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/discussions).

### Entrace task, application form

The deadline to complete all of these is April 19, 18:00 (UTC). If you want feedback on a proposal, then you must complete these steps one week earlier and select the option in the sktime application form.

1. Entrance task. Make a pull request (PR) to sktime to show you are able to contribute meaningfully.
    - Your PR does not need to be merged at the time of application.
    - To find out how to contribute to sktime, look at our [new contributor starter issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime/issues/1147) and [developer guide](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/developer_guide.html). 
    - Alternatively, if you are already experienced in using git and GitHub in a collaborative environment, you can skip this step. In this case, in the form in step 2 below, please provide a link to publicly visible evidence for your experience.
2. Fill in and submit the sktime application form at (https://forms.gle/MVcf9Q45Ui1ByMxM8).
    - You should have completed your entrance task (point 1 above) before submitting the form, since you need to provide a link to it in the form.
    - Please ensure you attach a project proposal to the application form. This is optional for other internships like GSoC where you submit the project elsewhere, but please ensure you submit your proposal through the sktime internship form.
    - You can base your proposal on the list of proposed projects (see below), your entrance task, or your own independent idea - whichever you choose, we aim to evaluate fairly and primarily on quality.
    - We can also recommend the guidelines from GSoC on writing proposals: https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal.

After the deadline on May 19 has passed, we will process the information provided and tell you the outcome no later than May 26. There are two possible outcomes:
- Progress to interview. See below.
- Rejection. Though this may be disheartening for you, this is only from the internship, for which there are only a limited number of slots. This should not discourage you from pursuing open source contributions, either with sktime or another package. E.g. you may still be eligible for our (unpaid) 1-1 mentoring.

### Interview

If successful in the above steps, we will invite you to a structured interview (ca. 30 to 60 minutes length; to be finalised) with a panel made up of core community members of `sktime`.
The interview will happen in the two days of May 23, 30. Please keep these dates free if possible.

During the interview:
- we will ask you to give a short (5 to 10 minutes; to be finalised) presentation on a piece of Python code that you wrote. Please be ready to screen share your code or to send a link to the repo containing your code.
- we will ask about your motivation to join sktime, your previous experience, your suitability for the specified project, and technical questions on data science and Python.

After the interview, we will shortlist candidates and assign them to available internship slots.

When we inform you of the outcome of the interview, there are two possibilities:
* Acceptance. This means you are accepted to the sktime internship.
* Tentative acceptance. This means we would like to accept you to the sktime internship,
  but the internship slot is not confirmed yet, e.g., since you are on a waiting list.
  In this case, you will receive mentoring and can participate in the onboarding events;
  a definite outcome will be communicated no later than June 16.
* A rejection. This means you are not eligible for the full internship.
  - We understand this will be disheartening for you,
  but we only have a limited amount of internship slots every year.
  We will always welcome anybody interested in contributing to sktime.

## Selection criteria for initial application phase

In the above, the following are used for selection:

* quality of the entrance task
* quality of the proposal
* performance in the structured interview (for content see above)
* prior contributions to `sktime`, if applicable
* prior interactions with the community, if applicable

## Mid-term evaluation

At the midpoint of the internship, July 14 under the unaltered schedule,
your and your mentor are expected to submit a formal evaluation of each other.

Based on this and your contributions up until then, a decision will be made on
whether to continue the internship for the remaining period.

The default and by far most common outcome is continuation,
the main criterion for early termination is non-engagement.

## What we expect from you
We expect good performance over the whole project.

Our expectations for participants before the internship starts:
 * You are interested in time series, machine learning, statistics, API design and software architecture.
 * You like coding in Python.
 * You are familiar with the basic data science ecosystem in Python, including numpy, pandas and scikit-learn.
 * You enjoy working with a vibrant team of experienced ML scientists and software engineers.
 * You are enthusiastic about open-source.

Our expectations for participants during the internship:
* You follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_involved/code_of_conduct.html).

* You engage with the sktime community and other interns or mentees.
* You peer-review a fellow student's work in the middle and at the end of the internship.
* You write weekly blog posts and a final summary post at the end of the project.
* You consider becoming a *long-term* developer and contributor, stepping up to become a leader in open source toolbox development.


## What you can expect from us

The expectations on you are high, but you can expect just as much from us. You should expect:
* We follow the [Code of Conduct](https://www.sktime.net/en/stable/get_involved/code_of_conduct.html).
* 1-1 mentoring with an experienced contributor, with weekly meetings.
