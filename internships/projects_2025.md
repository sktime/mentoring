## Mid-year project ideas 2025

Below is a list of ideas for longer mid-year projects 2025 with `sktime`.
For getting started or smaller projects, see our curated list of [good first issues and advice on getting started as an sktime developer](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/issues/1147).

The below list is only an ideas starter - we welcome and actively encourage bringing your own ideas to the table!
